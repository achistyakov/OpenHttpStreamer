Prerequesties.

For building all the prerequesties use documentation followed by specified
product.

- scons. SCons is software construction tool, or make tool--that is, 
a software utility for building software. Used for building the whole
project. Can be downloaded here -- http://scons.org/download.php, or 
installed from packages in your system. Version 1.3 or greater will
satisfy.

- g++. GNU C++ compiler. Can be acquired here -- http://gcc.gnu.org, 
or installed from packages in your system. The videocycle project uses
C++0x C++ dialect now, so compiler should be compliant with new standard.
gcc version 4.3.0 will satisfy. 

- boost. Boost is a collection of libraries and headers to extend C++
functionality. Can be downloaded here - http://www.boost.org/users/download/,
or installed from packages in your system. Version 1.39 or greater will
satisfy.

Configuring.
To make explicit configure run "scons configure" in project root dir. Configure
checks necessary dependencies and reports which dependencies were not 
satisfied and why. Calling this explicitly as usual is not necessary - configure
script is called automatically.

Building.
To build project run "scons". The building script implicitly calls configure, 
if configure is not present already. The "release" build configuration is 
used as default. To specify it explicitly call "scons build=<config name>" 
where <config name> is "debug", "release" or "all" without quotation marks. 
To clean previously built call scons --clean. The "release" build 
configuration is cleaned as default. To clean another build configuration 
specify it explicitly as described above. If necessary headers or libraries 
are not in standard include or lib path you should specify it like 
"includes=<path1>,<path2> ..." for non-typical include path and 
"libpath=<path1>,<path2> ... " for non-typical library path. The script
tries to decide which boost library suffix is present in system. If there is
a configure error specify it implicitly using "boost-suffix=<boost-suffix>".

Installing.
To install the result tool run "scons install". It installs result executable
into /usr/local/bin directory. To explicitly specify path to install set 
"prefix=<path_prefix"
