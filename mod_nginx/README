nginx mp4frag module is used for http streaming

BUILD.
    Get module here. github.com/inventos/OpenHttpStreamer
    Get nginx here: http://nginx.org/download/ and unpack it.
    In nginx directory run 
    
	./configure --add-module=<path to module>
	
    Of course you can add some other options on your need.
    After that in nginx source directory run
    
	make
	sudo make install
	
    This will build nginx only with mp4frag module and install it. Complete parameters guide search in nginx documentation.

CHECK.
    You need some non-fragmented mp4-file (or files with single source but different bitrate) to check work of module. 
    You can use mp4frag to build source data structures.
    Use:
    
	mp4frag --src <mp4file> (--src <mp4file-other-bitrate> ...) --template.
	
    This will generate two files - manifest.f4m and index. After that moving the source mp4-s is forbiden without 
rebuilding the index. 

    Setup your nginx server. Parameters which should be present in config file are written in
mp4frag.conf, and exact values of parameters are depending on your wishable config. Only the "location" parameter
should be set as shown. Start nginx with new parameters.
    For testing purposes  let's create in nginx docroot directory directory test_ohs. Put manifest.f4m and index files, 
generated on previous step to this dir and be shure the user by which nginx is run can read the directory, where mp4
files are located. The setup completed.
    Try to check make some http requests, for example
    
	wget -O /dev/null "http://your-server-address/path/<qual_num>/Seg1-Frag<fragment-num>"
	
    where 
    <qual_num> - quality level, starting from 0. The total amount of quality levels is determined as amount of sources.
    <fragment-num> - number of fragment you request, starting from 0. Roughly the number of fragments is length of movie in 
seconds divided by 4.
    The successfull request should return 200 result. If so you may continue reading article located
